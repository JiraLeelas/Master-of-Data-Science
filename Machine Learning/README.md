## Module Overview
The Machine Learning module introduces essential concepts of statistical computing for data science applications through R (programming). It covers feature selection, regularization, and flexible polynomial regression methods for modeling. Additionally, it explores supervised machine learning techniques, including decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning.

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 is a multiple choice assignment on the Durham University Blackboard system to check the concepts learned from the module.

## Assignment 2
In this study, we compare decision trees and random forests to model the quality of red and white wine based on their physicochemical properties. Three tree-based models were developed: a pruned single tree (56.37%), a k-fold cross-validation tree model (64.73%), and a random forest (85.52%). The variable importance plot from the random forest model identifies alcohol, free sulfur dioxide, and volatile acidity as the three most significant factors in determining wine quality.
