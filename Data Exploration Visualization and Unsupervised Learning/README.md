## Module Overview
Data Exploration Visualization and Unsupervised learning is module that explores the concepts and methods of visualization and exploratory data analysis of distinct data types. Also, it dives into topic of dimension reduction, unsupervised learning, and clustering through R (programming). 

## Assignment 1
This project revolves around the exploration and trendline analysis of Plastic Pollution from Our World in Data. Scatter plots by income status illustrate that high-income countries exhibit variability in the scatter plot with two identifiable linear trends, high and low incline slope. This is hypothesized to the varying plastic disposal in high-income countries. Other income-status countries have a more defined linear correlation between the two wastes with a steeper slope.

## Assignment 2
Time series change of atmospheric gas concentration at Mauna Loa is explored in this project. We utilized factor analysis to uncover that the underlying gases could be described by two gas groups, greenhouse and incomplete combustion gases. Applying the clustering algorithm of k-means and hierarchy clustering revealed that the gaps within the time series data lead to different cluster results. This difference is attributed to the difference in the clustering algorithm.
